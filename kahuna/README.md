# Kahuna

The media search & management app.

## Note

This app uses Angular 1.4.3 which is subject to https://www.sourceclear.com/registry/security/arbitrary-code-execution-through-svg-animation-functionality/javascript/sid-2253/fix.

This does not in it's current state effect the application as user uploaded SVGs are not allowed, though if this were to change in the future Angular must also be upgraded to avoid a security issue.
